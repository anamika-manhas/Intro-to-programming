  <h1>IMPORTANT NOTES</h1>
  <h2> How The Web Works :</h2>
  <p>
    when you enter something like google.com the request goes to one of many special computers on the internet
    known as domain servers <strong>(DNS)</strong>.All these requests are routed through various routers
    and switches.The domain name servers keep tables of machine names and their<em> IP addresses</em>,so when you
    type in google.com it get translated into a number, which identifies the computers that serve the google website
    to you. When you want to view any page on the Web, you must initiate the activity by requesting a page using your browser.
    The browser asks a domain name server to translate the domain name you requested into an IP address.
    The browser then sends a request to that server for the page you want, using a standard called Hypertext Transfer Protocol or <b>HTTP</b>.

    which refers to "How It Looks".<b>HTML</b> is the Language of Web Development. Usually HTML documents are stored on
    servers, which provide the necessary documents to the users whenver a user acceses a webpage. The data is sent to the user's
    System which is furthur interpretted by the Web Browser in use, this data is then displayed to the user.

  <h5> Why Computers are Stupid :</h5>
  <p>
    <strong>Computers</strong> are stupid because they interpret instructions
      literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a
      small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems
      in a program. they do whatever we make them to do. They just follows the instructions given to them.
  </p>

  <h6>Inline vs Block Elements :</h6>
  <p>
    Every <b>HTML</b> element has a default display value depending on what type of element it is.
    The default display value for most elements is inline or block.
    Example of block-level elements :
      &lt;
      div&gt;
       &lt;
       p&gt;
        &lt;
        form&gt;
      example of inline elements :
      &lt;
      b&gt;
       &lt;
       em&gt;
      span&gt;
